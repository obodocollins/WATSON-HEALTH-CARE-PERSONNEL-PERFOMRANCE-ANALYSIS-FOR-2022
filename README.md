4. The Life science department also had the highest job involvement rating.

5. Personels with married marital status were rated more than the other two marital status (single and divorced)

6. The human resource department is the least involved with educational developement

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The department with highest monthly income is the Maternity department BUT it is not the most performing department.
   This shows that the pay of this department is not commesurate with their Job input. Since productivity is linked to input,
   a review of the salary structure of the best performing and the departments with good job involvement rating should be done otherwise
   in a very short while a decline in the job input of personnels in those departments will most likely be expirienced.

3. From the analysis, it was seen that personels that a married performed better than than the other two marital status (single and divorced) therefore,

4.  it is recommended that HR employs people with married marital status to boost employee perfomance

5. The human resouce department has the least involvement in education, incentives should be given to those who wish to futher their education to encourage other to do the same.
